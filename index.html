          <h3>Here is a timeline of Konrad Zuse's life          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1910</strong> - He was Born on 22 June 1910 in Berlin, Germany.</li>
            <li><strong>1912</strong> - He moved with his family to the East Prussian Braunsberg (now Braniewo in Poland).</li>
            <li><strong>1923</strong> - He attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg.</li>
            <li><strong>1928</strong> - He passed his Abitur, qualifying him to enter university.</li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - He enrolled in the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating. He experimented in the construction of computers in his parents' flat on Wrangelstraße 38, moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin.</li>
            <li><strong>For a Time</strong> - He worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his considerable artistic skills in the design of advertisements.</li>
            <li><strong>Then</strong> - He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, which he found mind-numbingly boring, leading him to dream of doing them by machine.</li>            
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - While working in his parents apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35 mm film.</li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. </li>
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - He finished the Z1 in 1938. The Z1 contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision.</li>
            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Zuse was called to military service, where he was given the resources to ultimately build the Z2.</li>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - In 1940, the German government began funding him through the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute, forerunner of the DLR),[23] which used his work for the production of glide bombs. Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines, which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio-controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an integrated analog-to-digital converter under program control, making it the first process-controlled computer.<br>In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2, covering several rooms in the parental flat, to experts of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL; i.e. German Research Institute for Aviation). The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone relays.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> -The DVL granted research subsidies so that in 1941 Zuse started a company, Zuse Apparatebau (Zuse Apparatus Construction), to manufacture his machines,[16] renting a workshop on the opposite side in Methfesselstraße 7 and stretching through the block to Belle-Alliance Straße 29 (renamed and renumbered as Mehringdamm 84 in 1947).<br><br>On the same year, He invented the world's first programmable computer, which is his greatest achievement; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer. Zuse was also noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941, producing the Z4, which became the world's first commercial computer.</li>
            
            <li><strong>1943-1945</strong> - From 1943 to 1945 he designed the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül.</li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents' flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.</li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Konrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945, employing a carriage, himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil, for Zuse attached importance to a "noble ceremony". Their son Horst, the first of five children, was born in November 1945.           <br>In the Same year, On 3 February The Aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the Luisenstadt, the area around Oranienstraße, including neighbouring houses. This event effectively brought Zuse's research and development to a complete halt.</li>
            <li><strong>1947</strong> - According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse.[32] It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The encounter had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing.</li>
            <li><strong>1967</strong> - In 1967, Zuse also suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure. And also by 1967, the Zuse KG had built a total of 251 computers. Owing to financial problems, the company was then sold to Siemens.</li> 
                        

            <li><strong>1969</strong> - Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book Rechnender Raum (Calculating Space). He published the book Rechnender Raum (translated into English as Calculating Space). This idea has attracted a lot of attention, since there is no physical evidence against Zuse's thesis. Edward Fredkin (1980s), Jürgen Schmidhuber (1990s), and others have expanded on it.</li>
            <li><strong>1987-1989</strong> - Between 1987 and 1989, Zuse recreated the Z1, suffering a heart attack midway through the project. It cost 800,000 DM, (approximately $500,000) and required four individuals (including Zuse) to assemble it. Funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by Siemens and a consortium of five companies.</li>
            <li><strong>Retired</strong> - After he retired, he focused on his hobby of painting. Zuse was an atheist.</li>
            <li><strong>1995</strong> - Zuse died on 18 December 1995 in Hünfeld, Germany (near Fulda) from heart failure.</li>

            <strong><strong>Zuse Year 2010</strong></h2>
            <br>
<p id="zuseYear2010">The 100th anniversary of the birth of this computer pioneer was celebrated by exhibitions, lectures and workshops to remember his life and work and to bring attention to the importance of his invention to the digital age. The movie Tron: Legacy, which revolves around a world inside a computer system, features a character named Zuse, presumably in honour of Konrad Zuse. German posts DP AG issued a commemorative stamp at this occasion, June 6, 2010: a Zuse portrait, composed solely by the binary code numbers 1 and 0 in fine print.</p>

            <p> "We should be most thankful to the great man <strong>Konrad Zuse</strong> who build the first modern programable computer. It was his greatest achivement and a great gift for  us. We should remember the Civil Engineer who invented the first high-level programming language. We would not be using today's modern computer without his great invention."</p>
